# Environment setting (Linux (Ubuntu) and Anaconda)
- Create virtual environment 
> conda create -n g2d_diff python=3.8.10

- Activate environment
> conda activate g2d_diff
 
- Install required packages
> pip install -r requirement.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113

The installation typically takes around 10 minutes, but the time may vary depending on the environment.

# IMPORTANT!
You can download all processed datasets, model checkpoints in this google drive link.  
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qk4Wwkqvwas7kpjcuFKbSCT8aPaP8RKI/view?usp=drive_link  
You must unpack this zip file in the repository folder.  


In G2D-Diff directory...    
  -- data <- Need to download from the link above.  
  -- src

If you have any problem in downloading the data and model checkpoints, feel free to ask me by email (hyunho.kim@kitox.re.kr).  

# Generation tutorial
- GenerationTutorial.ipynb
 
Generation with the trained condition encoder and diffusion model.  
It will take about 15 minutes for a single genotype input (ex. a cell line), but the time may vary depending on the environment.  

Check the comments in the notebook for further information about the source code.  
(ex. saving checkpoints. You may need to create a directory for saving.)

# Reproducing the models
Use the following jupyter notebooks after adding the kernel. 
> python -m ipykernel --user --name g2d_diff


For all .py file and jupyter notebooks for reproducing the models, check the comments for further information.  
(ex. saving checkpoints. You may need to create a directory for saving.)
